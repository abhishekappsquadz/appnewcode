                <h2><strong>Hire QA Tester</strong> for High Quality Output</h2>
                <p class="contentText">Mobile application testing originated as a minor adaptation of general application testing, but has rapidly assumed a highly specialized quality assurance (QA) flavor given the rapid proliferation of devices, device platforms, mobility standards, and the logarithmic adoption of mobile solutions for a variety of enterprise and consumer applications that were previously reserved to enterprise or home computing. Furthermore, the rapidly evolving mobile solution landscape and the lack of universal standards, tools, and matured segment-specific practices have led Mobile testing to a new level of challenges. AppSquadz Technologies Pvt. Ltd. understands the unique testing needs of the emerging mobile solutions segment and capitalizes on its extensive QA expertise to provide highly mature mobile solutions testing offerings that cover all key facets of Mobile testing needs.
