                                    <p>To treat each patient on mobile or desktop and to suggest them the right diet, medication and exercise, huge data has to be stored, managed and processed by IT tools and technologies across multiple devices.

                                    <p>The healthcare industry, and pharma in particular, doesn't have the best reputation thanks in part to controversies over subjects like drug pricing. That has created a trust gap in which consumers as well as physicians are less likely to trust ads and information that come from healthcare marketers.</p>

                                    <p>Traditional measures of treating patients and providing nursing and care are inadequate in today’s digital health marketplace. Patient experience (PX) is the dominant driver for technology investments and innovative programs. Most health systems do not have effective means to capture patient feedback.</p>

To gratify the audiences of all ages is a challenge because in this industry, patients are more interested in efficiency, integration with other channels, value-based care than just appealing interfaces.</p>
