                           I chose Konstant because they have a number of services that we could accommodate well not only my current projects but also to future developments. They also had a good global representation and good reviews.

                        <p>What’s most impressive about Konstant is their skill for communication and understanding. I have an incredibly competent account manager assigned to me. He takes the time to read content and listens to any communication provided. If there is any misunderstanding, he seeks clarification. He understands exactly what is required of my products and has been involved from day one. Additionally, on the rare occasion when he is not available, the other staff members are equally competent in their communication and understanding.</p>
