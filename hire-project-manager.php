                        <h2>Advantages of <strong>Hiring Dedicated Project Manager</strong></h2>
                        <p class="contentText">Good Project Managers provide the motivation team members need to help bring a project to successful completion. Among the advantages of having a project manager:</p>
                        <p class="contentText"><strong>Cost Management:</strong> A good project manager will save you money through avoidance of unnecessary costs brought about by poor management. With proper planning and execution, a good project manager will always likely to maximize funds and stick to stick within the budget. Additionally, a good project manager would have developed strong relationships with best-in-class vendors over the years which can help in leveraging the costs.<br><br>
                            <strong>Risk Management:</strong> Employing the services of a good project manager eliminates the chances of absolute project failure. Every project has a certain amount of risks, but with a good project manager, any problem that arise in the middle of the project, he/she is likely to make timely decisions to resolve the problem or mitigate the potential risks. A good project manager is also likely to bring out the best out of individual team members and hence reduce the risk in the project.<br><br>
                            <strong>Time Management:</strong> A good project manager will not only save the client money but also time for he will ensure complete ownership of the project right from the start to finish hence freeing the client to focus on other issues. All too often, in-house representatives of projects take on additional responsibilities that are ancillary to their ongoing duties—and often outside their realm of expertise. Unless a firm has internal professionals who have the requisite project management expertise as well as the time to dedicate to this huge undertaking, it is best to hire an outside specialist whose core competency is project management. This will not only allow him to fully focus on the project but also allow other employees to focus on their respective areas of expertise.<br><br>
                            <strong>Effective Strategy:</strong> A good project manager will always ensure collaboration and ownership among parties involved to check the work that has been completed, find possible obstacles and anticipate other possible problems during the course of the project. A good project manager will always ensure timely coordination and integration of everyone involved in the project.<br><br>
                            <strong>Prevent scope creep:</strong> A good project manager will always prevent scope creep. Whether its time or money, or both eating away at the project success, you can be assured that both are as a result of scope creep. Successful project management controls the flow of a project and keeps team members focused on and working within the original scope.<br><br>
                            <strong>Ensure Optimal Results:</strong> A good project manager will always ensure optimal results since he is highly skilled, trained to lead a project from start to completion and within the allocated time and budget. They will always analyse the client’s needs and provide the right resources to ensure the deliverables are of the highest quality.
