                <h2>Design Methodology</h2>
                <p class="contentText">Design Thinking: The methodology commonly referred to as design thinking is a proven and repeatable problem-solving protocol that any business or profession can employ to achieve extraordinary results.The practice of co-design allows users to become an active part of the creative development of a application product by interacting directly with application wireframes, mockups or design by collaborating with research team. It is grounded in the belief that all people are creative and that users, as experts of their own experiences, bring different points of view that inform design and innovation direction.
                    Co-design is a method that can be used in all stages of the design process, but especially in the ideation or concepting phases. Partnering with users ensures their inclusion in knowledge development, idea generation, and concept development on products whose ultimate goal is to best serve these same users.
                </p>
                <h2>Design &amp; UI/UX Experience</h2>
                <p class="contentText">Although Design is most often used to describe an object or end result, Design in its most effective form is a process, an action, a verb not a noun. A protocol for solving problems and discovering new opportunities. Techniques and tools differ and their effectiveness are arguable but the core of the process stays the same. It's taken years of slogging through Design = high style to bring us full circle to the simple truth about design thinking. That it is a most powerful tool and when used effectively, can be the foundation for driving a brand or business forward.<br>UI/UX design can be the difference between user delight, and user dismay. That's why we have a team of experienced mobile designers that are seriously serious about pixels. Behind every great mobile app, there's a story about great design. How does it feel? How do actual humans interact with it? What hooks them? At AppSquadz Technologies Pvt Ltd., our design-creatives, build-feels approach directs everything we do. Most mobile shops talk about great engineering and pleasing design — but few actually deliver. AppSquadz Technologies Pvt Ltd. is at the top of a very short list of companies that do both Well. And we should be at the top of your list for app design & mobile development support.</p>
